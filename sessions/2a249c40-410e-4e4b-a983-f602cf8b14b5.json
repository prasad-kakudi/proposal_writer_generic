Private and non-public schools are also eligible to apply if they have their 501c3 designation or have a fiscal sponsor. \n\nCan an organization submit more than one proposal?\nNo. Submit your most compelling proposal, as multiple awards will not be granted to a single organization due to the competitive applicant pool.\n\nIs there a certain amount of money allocated?\nIn this grant cycle, Golden 1 Credit Union has committed more than $1,500,000 to be allocated in multi-year grants ranging from $20,000 to $100,000. Individual grant awards will take into consideration the quality of the proposal as well as equitable distribution of resources across impact areas and geographic areas. \n\nWe are a fiscal sponsor for several different organizations. Can we apply on behalf of more than one organization?\nYes. Golden 1 applauds cost-saving collaborations and welcomes proposals from fiscal sponsors for each of the supported entities\n\nIs there a minimum/maximum amount to apply for?\nYes, the minimum annual grant amount will be $10,000 and the maximum grant amount will be $50,000. Grant requests cannot exceed 30% of an organizationâ€™s annual operating budget, and you are not guaranteed to be awarded the amount requested.\n\nAre smaller grant requests more likely to be fully funded?\nYes. Due to the competitive applicant pool and finite grants budget, it is more likely that smaller requests will be fully funded than larger requests.  \n\nIs there a particular timeline for the grant period?\nYes. This grant cycle funds activity from 2025-2027.\n\nDoes my agency headquarters have to be in the Central Valley or Sacramento Valley? No. However, the programs you offer must be in one of these regions, as defined in this RFP, and must be serving the residents of the counties listed.\n\nCan Golden 1 Credit Unionâ€™s funds be used as matching funds to meet federal grant requirements? \nYes. Golden 1 Credit Union funds can be used as matching funds. Please explain the match requirement in your narrative and reflect it in your proposed budget.\n\nI applied in previous years but did not receive funding. Should I apply again? \nYes. Just because your project did not get funded in previous years does not mean it will not get funded this year. If your organization aligns with Golden 1 Credit Unionâ€™s impact areas, you are able to specify how the funds will be effectively utilized, you can point to specific outcomes driven by your work, and you strictly follow the application instructions (including these FAQs!), you will be a strong candidate.
